AL's Questionable Paradigm - The Choice Is Yours

------------------------
short game description:
------------------------

Our game idea is a mixture of “The Stanley Parable” and “Please, Don't Touch Anything”.
You wake up in a futuristic room and hear a voice talking to you.
It is an AI called AL who explains your circumstances to you.
What do they want and why are you here?
Taking the right actions and solving problems the AI poses to you might lead you through this experience,
but your choices matter!
With different paths and endings, anything can happen!
