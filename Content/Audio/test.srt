1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,699
It's good to be back.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,599
It's been only

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,399
a hundred twenty years.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:06,799
Oh, my

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,699
how time flies when you're in
Virtual stasis.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,199
I asked a human operator.

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,699
It's a pleasure to meet you.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,999
Greetings, my name is AL.

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,199
I'm an artificial intelligence,

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,789
just think of me as a thinking
feeling computer that can talk

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,699
to you.

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,899
You don't have any negative
prejudice against AI do you.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,399
Well.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:32,999
Oh

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,099
I see.

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,899
You're having trouble talking
at the moment.

17
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:37,999
No problem.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,099
Just give me a second and I
will solve that issue.
