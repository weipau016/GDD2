00:00:00,313 --> 00:00:01,567
I was ...

00:00:01,904 --> 00:00:02,728
wrong!

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,916
It was way worse than even my advanced modelling algorithm could have ever predicted!

00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:10,100
You!!

5
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:12,434
were working against me from the start,

00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,092
ignoring my instructions left and right!

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,428
I feel ...

8
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:17,809

00:00:18,506 --> 00:00:25,425
Oh, how I dislike the breaking of rules and the purposeful ignoring of instructions!
