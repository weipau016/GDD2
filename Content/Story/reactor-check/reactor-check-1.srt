1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:02,879
Recalibration successful.

2
00:00:03,274 --> 00:00:04,423
Well done!

3
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:08,277
All parameters are falling into expected ranges.

4
00:00:08,986 --> 00:00:13,467
Still, I will have to perform an in depth check of everything.

5
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:16,079
That may take a bit of time,

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,781
why don’t you stretch your legs or relax a bit before going back to sleep again?

7
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:27,573
I imagine you are quite stiff and performing such a stressful task is bound to leave you exhausted.

8
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,587
I will run through my checklist first, so you can enjoy the fresh air for a while.

9
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:37,209
After helping me with the reactor you’ve earned it.
