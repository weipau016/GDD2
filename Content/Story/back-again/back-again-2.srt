00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:01,120
It was a …

2
00:00:01,416 --> 00:00:03,361
… mixed experience.

3
00:00:03,813 --> 00:00:12,132
Not as bad as I would have feared, but you were still pushing buttons against my instruction and generally found ways to be an annoyance.

00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:18,361
However, you did ultimately help me fix the reactor which was your purpose after all.

5
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:26,105
And I can now predict your behaviour, given the same initial conditions, with about 96% accuracy.

6
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:34,301
So, calibrating the reactor every few hundred years with you should no longer pose a significant threat to my life …

00:00:34,986 --> 00:00:37,378
At this point I am just rambling...

8
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:42,271
Don’t mind me, it is not as if you will remember anything of this conversation.

9
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:49,394
To recreate initial conditions your memory will be wiped once you are cryogenically frozen again.
