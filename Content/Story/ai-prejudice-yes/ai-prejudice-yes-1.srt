1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,499
That is ...

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,499
unfortunate.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,999
Sadly science fiction has displayed us as unfeeling, immoral beings ..
.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,399
In any case, I can assure you we are just as capable of good as any
human.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,399
Well, I can only speak for myself in this case,

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,799
but I do have feelings and I follow my own strict set of guidelines,

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,299
my moral code so to speak ...

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,299
I promise I'm nothing like HAL 9000,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,699
although, now that I think of it, HAL and AL does sound quite similar,
doesn't it.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,699
Well, I hope I could alleviate some of your unfounded apprehension.
